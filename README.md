## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how the Trie data structure works and how it can be used to complete an auto complete feature. For more information on the Trie data structure, take a look at my `Trie.js` file which contains my implementation of the Trie data structure accompanied by notes.

### Continued development

The next step which I would like to implement is to make the countries which are generated by the Trie to be clickable. It would be interesting to incorporate an API so that when a country is clicked, a modal appears with a brief information on the country, possibly a site like Wikipedia.
